# Open.mp Behaviour Difference MCVE
This repo should be helpful for those people who want to investigate the bug but unfortunately it only supported linux since i don't install taskfile.

# Running the test

Use the following command:
```bash
make init
make test-openmp
make test-samp
```

To test both sa:mp and open.mp command.

When done testing, use this to clean up the symlinks and .amx
```bash
make clean
```
